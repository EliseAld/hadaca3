By participating to this challenge, you accept to publicly share your submissions.

You can freely test your methods on this benchmark and compare yourself to the reference methods. When your development is finished or stable, please create a team with the following nomenclature : “Feature selection for DNAm” [met] + “Feature selection for RNA” [rna] / “Deconvolution method” [both]. The idea is to gather the similar approaches under the same team. Don’t hesitate to send an email to the organisers if you have any questions or issues.
