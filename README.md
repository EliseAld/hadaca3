# hadaca3

HADACA 3 is the third edition of a Health Data Challenge, organized by the PEPR Santé Numérique (M4DI axis) and the University Grenoble-Alpes data challenges hub (TIMC, IAB and GRICAD). It will take place from December 2nd to 6th, 2024, 

The goal of this challenge is to explore and potentially discover new methods to resolve deconvolution problems.

The HADACA 3 challenge begins with a bulk dataset in the form of a matrix, containing the expression profiles of k different cells. Participants are required to retrieve the expression type of each cell using any available methods, such as machine learning.

Participants will submit their method in the form of an R program, which will then be ingested and scored using a ground truth matrix. In the final phase of this challenge, the best method submitted by each participant will be evaluated on a different dataset. The aim of this final phase is to ensure the method is not overfitted.
